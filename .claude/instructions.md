# Project Development Rules

## General Rules

1. **Git Commit and Push Policy**: Prompt the user to commit and push changes. NEVER commit or push changes without explicit approval from the user. Always ask first before running any git commit or git push commands.

## Feature Development Process Rules

1. **Step-by-Step Execution**: Execute feature development step-by-step for each feature phase. Break down work into clear, manageable steps and complete them one at a time.

2. **User Approval Between Steps**: Pause after completing each step and ask for input from the user before moving to the next step. Wait for explicit approval to proceed.
